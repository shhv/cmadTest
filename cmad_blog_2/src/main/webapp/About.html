					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Bloggers is a privately held website, the flagship site of the Chit Chat Network, created in 2016 by Sindhu S and Shruthi V. It was created to be a more open alternative to earlier Q&A sites such as Experts-Exchange. The name for the website was chosen by voting in June 2016 by so called masters of CMAD</p>
					<p>It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. DUH !! </p>
					<p>The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to imagine vote questions and answers up or down and delete questions in a fashion similar to a wiki or Digg.</p>
